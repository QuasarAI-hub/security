# Wallet Security Best Practices

## Why Security Matters üõ°Ô∏è

Your crypto wallet is like a bank account. But unlike traditional banks:
- No password reset option
- No customer support to recover funds
- No insurance for lost tokens
- No way to reverse transactions

## Choose Your Wallet Type üíº

### Hardware Wallets (Most Secure)
These are physical devices that look like USB sticks:

‚úÖ **Recommended for:**
- Storing large amounts
- Long-term holding
- Maximum security

Popular options:
- Ledger Nano X/S
- Trezor Model T/One

### Software Wallets (More Convenient)
Apps on your phone or computer:

‚úÖ **Good for:**
- Daily transactions
- Smaller amounts
- Regular use

Trusted options:
- Keplr (Web/Mobile)
- Cosmostation (Mobile)
- Leap Wallet (Web/Mobile)

## Seed Phrase Protection üîë

### What is a Seed Phrase?
- 12 or 24 words that give access to your wallet
- Like the master key to your crypto
- Cannot be changed or reset
- Must be kept absolutely secret

### How to Store Your Seed Phrase

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Write it on paper (multiple copies)
- Store in waterproof container
- Keep in secure location(s)
- Consider a metal backup

‚ùå **NEVER:**
- Store digitally
- Take a photo
- Email to yourself
- Share with anyone
- Store in cloud

### Example Setup:
1. Write seed phrase on paper
2. Make 2-3 copies
3. Store in:
   - Home safe
   - Safety deposit box
   - Trusted family member's safe

## Practical Security Steps üì±

### Setting Up a New Wallet

1. **Clean Environment**

   - Close unnecessary apps
   - Disconnect from internet (for seed phrase creation)

2. **Installation**

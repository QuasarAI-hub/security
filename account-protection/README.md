# Account Protection Guide

## Why Account Protection Matters üõ°Ô∏è

Your crypto account is different from traditional accounts:
- No password resets
- No fraud department
- No transaction reversals

## Essential Security Layers üîí

### 1. Access Protection

‚ùå **Never use:**

- Sequential numbers
- Same password elsewhere

‚úÖ **Good example:**
```
Bad:  cosmos123
Good: C0sm0s#N3tw0rk!2024
```

   - Authy
   - Microsoft Authenticator

2. **Backup Codes**
